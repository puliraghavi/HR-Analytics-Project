## Problem Statement
In today's dynamic business landscape, organizations are increasingly recognizing the critical importance of leveraging data-driven insights to optimize their human resources strategies. The human resources (HR) department serves as the backbone of an organization, managing the most valuable asset: its workforce. Employing data analytics practices in this sector can help us gain deep insights into various aspects of employee retention, performance, and demographic trends within the organization.

The primary aim of this project is to delve into the data and scrutinize historical data and current trends,to study underlying factors influencing attrition rates and decipher patterns that may impact employee retentionand provide the orgination with actionable recommendations tailored to enhancing retention strategies and fostering smarter talent management decisions.
